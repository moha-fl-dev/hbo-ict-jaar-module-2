# Big O Analysis of Binary Search Implementation

This analysis focuses on the binary search implementation provided, specifically examining its time complexity and space complexity.

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: `O(1)`
  - In the best-case scenario, the target value `key` is located at the midpoint of the array on the first attempt. This results in an immediate match, leading to a constant time operation.
- **Worst Case and Average Case**: `O(log n)`
  - For the worst and average cases, the time complexity is logarithmic. The reason is that with each iteration of the loop, the search range is halved. This halving process continues until the `key` is found or the range is reduced to zero. Since the size of the search range decreases exponentially, the time complexity is `O(log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `sortedArray`.

## Space Complexity

- **`O(1)`**
  - The space complexity of this binary search implementation is constant. This is because the algorithm operates directly on the input array and only uses a fixed number of variables (`start`, `end`, `middle`) regardless of the size of the input array. There is no additional allocation of space that grows with the input size, making the space complexity `O(1)`.

## Conclusion

The provided binary search implementation is efficient in terms of both time and space. Its `O(log n`) time complexity makes it highly effective for searching within large, sorted datasets. Additionally, its constant space complexity ensures minimal additional memory usage, making it a space-efficient search method.
